Thoughts, ideas and notes about KeyMo.
--------------------------------------

- Need to come up with a nifty name for this thing. Possibilities:
  + Play off "keyboard" and "mouse"
    * Keymo (The winner)
    * Kemo

  + Play off "chorded keyboard" and "mouse"
    * Cheymo

- Needs to be USB HID compliant.

- 2 variations:
  + Single handed with 7 (maybe 8) buttons and a scroll wheel w/ wheel button.

  + Two handed with 16 buttons and a scroll wheel w/ wheel button.
    * Possibly use an RJ25 telephone cord to connect both units (at least until
      it becomes completely wireless)

  + In both variations, each hand will have a 7 bit (2^7; 127) combination.

    The 8th button is there to allow the thumb an easier way to press 3 buttons
    at the same time. I'm thinking that the 8th button would be mounted under a
    '3 button mount' (i.e. a rigid frame that can hold 3 separate bit switches;
    most likely shaped like a 'U' with one switch on each side and one at the
    bottom middle). The 8th button would connect the two side switches that
    would be difficult for the thumb to push while pushing the middle button at
    the same time.

    (Man, I need to get some sketches done of what this would look like; or
    maybe get it designed up in Blender or FreeCAD for 3d viewing; which will
    happen anyways).

- The following AVR microcontrollers with advantages/disadvantages:
  + ATtiny88:
    * Advantages:
      ! Tiny footprint:
        > 4mm (.157") for 28pin ATtiny-mmu
        > 5mm (.197") for 32pin ATtiny-mu

      ! IO pins:
        > 24 for 28pin ATtiny-mmu
        > 28 for 32pin ATtiny-mu

      ! Price (from digikey:
        > $0.72 from arrow.com ATtiny-mmu
        > $0.42 from newark.com ATtiny-mu

      ! I2C and SPI serial interfaces on both models

    * Disadvantages:
      ! 8KB flash (means program needs to be small, not neccessarily a minus)

      ! 512B RAM (not sure a minus)

      ! No PWM (although not really a minus for KeyMo)
